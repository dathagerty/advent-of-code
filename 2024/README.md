# 2024

Since I haven't done Advent of Code in a few years, this year will be solved with Golang as I am most familiar with it.
I am managing this repo with `jj` instead of `git`, so there is something slightly new here.

I'm probably going to end up revising how this directory is structured as the challenge goes on, so I won't document how to run things just yet.
